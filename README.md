## Shell Scripts
_various scripts to accomidate my lazyness_


#### pixivPool.sh
   * used alongside [PixivUtil2](https://github.com/Nandaka/PixivUtil2 "PixivUtil2"). iterates recursively through directory1,
     then checks if hardlink exists in directory2, if not it is created.
     this way i can keep pics organized, and also have a big image pool for plex(not endless folders)
     <br>_honestly theres probs a better way to do it w/ something like stow_
     <br>**stale**

#### opt.sh
   * todo
     <br>**stale**

   * todo
     <br>**stale**
   
#### lib2mp3.sh
   * creates an mp3 version of flac/alac/whatever music library.
     <br>**while preserving the folder structure**
     <br>had a massive script originally then realized the whole thing could be done in like 2 lines.
     <br>(its not 2 lines because parameters are nice etc..)
