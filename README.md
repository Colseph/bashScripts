## Shell Scripts
_various scripts to accomidate my lazyness_


#### pixivPool.sh
   * used alongside [PixivUtil2](https://github.com/Nandaka/PixivUtil2 "PixivUtil2"). iterates recursively through directory1,
     then checks if hardlink exists in directory2, if not it is created.
     this way i can keep pics organized, and also have a big image pool for plex(not endless folders)
