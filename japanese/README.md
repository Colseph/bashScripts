## Japanese
_A wonderful language. The study of which somehow manages to bring moments that rival temporary enlightenment, while at the same time leaving me more confused than a dog when it realizes the thing it just bit was its own tail._

### This folder contains random items that pertain to japanese.
Whether its scripts I've written to ease my journey, or random things I found interesting, you'll probably find them here.

### Scripts

#### [lolify]()
   * TODO
   * encoding script, literally same base as lib2mp3.sh
     <br>takes mkv files, spits out small mp4 files
     <br>video track and 1 audio track, no subs
   * mainly so i can save disk space(hence the name)
   * made so i can watch my BDs w/ out subs w/ minimal effort, but might also add in vrv/yt-dl stuff
     <br>_obv if that is added its an example implimentation for edu purposes only .._

#### [zombify]()
   * TODO
   * yes, another stupid name i know..
   * another reskin of lib2mp3.sh(it is a true masterpiece after all)
     <br>takes afformentioned mp4 files, and literally just takes the
     <br>mp3 audio out, for... well listening ofc
   * maybe someday ill do something with subs2srs or something to get
     <br>more dialogue out.. (but then id have to time subs so we'll see when that happens)
     - actually if i do do this ill probs write a custom script that measures time between dialogue
       <br>and just cut between if its over a threshold, since i personally think it would be
       <br>annoying to have constant skipping... idk ill have to test this is still a TODO after all..
