## Japanese
_A wonderful language. The study of which somehow manages to bring moments that
rival temporary enlightenment, while at the same time leaving me more confused
than a dog when it realizes the thing it just bit was its own tail._

   * encoding script, literally same base as lib2mp3.sh. takes mkv files, spits
     out small mp4 files w/ video track and 1 audio track, no subs
   * mainly so i can save disk space(hence the name)
   * made so i can watch my BDs w/ out subs w/ minimal effort.
   * ~~also has yt-dl integration.~~(removed)

#### [zombify](https://github.com/Colseph/scripts/blob/master/japanese/zombify)
   * yes, another stupid name i know..
   * based off lib2mp3.sh(it is a true masterpiece after all) takes
     afformentioned mp4 files, and literally just takes the audio --> mp3,
