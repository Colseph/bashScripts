## Japanese Study Workflow

_Using [MIA](https://massimmersionapproach.com/) as a guide, so this will be listed out in stages._
 * Each stage will contain what I did/am doing in that stage.

### Stage 01

#### Specifics

| Immersion Type    | Hours | Input Source           |
|:-----------------:|:-----:|:----------------------:|
| Passive Listening | 5+    | Anime Audio/podcasts   |
| Active Listening  | 1+    | Anime/TV               |
| Active Reading    | 1+    | Subs/VNs/Doujins/Manga |
| SRS               | 1+    |                        |

_usually I get about 2+ Hrs total of Active Immersion  
whether its Listening, Reading, or SRS_

#### Flow

* **Anime/TV shows**  
  I'll pick a show I want to watch, if I have the BD I'll use [MakeMKV](https://www.makemkv.com/) to get the mkv files on my computer,  
  then I'll [lolify](https://github.com/Colseph/scripts/blob/master/japanese/lolify) the mkv's to save space and eliminate the extra tracks(if there are any). Next, depending  
  on whether or not I want to focus on Reading or Listening I'll Download Japanese Subtitles from [kitsuneko](https://kitsunekko.net/)  
  and watch the mp4's on my pc with [mpv](https://mpv.io/) using `zZ` to adjust subtitle timing if needed.  As I find 1T sentences, I'll  
  use `s` to take a screenshot, and later I'll find the line in the sub file(hopefully I'll find a better way to do this)
  
* **VNs**  
  For Visual Novels, I'll use [ITH](https://code.google.com/archive/p/interactive-text-hooker/) to automatically copy the 1T sentences to a clipboard, then I can just paste  
  straight into a text file for later use. I will also have [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) open to a blank html page with [autoscroll](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/autoscrolling/), and  
  [yomichan](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yomichan/) so I can quickly look up a word if its _really_ bugging me.

* **Dougins/Manga**  
  I'll Generally just read them on my phone, using [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/). I'll just screenshot 1T sentences, and add  
  them to srs later.

* **Passive Listening**  
  Generally my Passive Listening is Anime audio. Once I've _finished_ a show(to avoid spoilers), I'll run [zombify](https://github.com/Colseph/scripts/blob/master/japanese/zombify) to get  
  mp3's which I'll either throw on my phone or my Ipod. I'll keep an earbud in during most of the day at work and I'll  
  generally keep it playing in the car on my way to and from. Since I have a lot more time for Passive Immersion than  
  Active Immersion, I'll generally finish listening to the audio from the last series, before I've finished the series
  I'm currently watching. When this happens, I'll usually listen to podcasts, or random series I've watched a long time  
  ago that I dont plan on watching again anytime sooon.

* **SRS**  
  For Kanji, I'm working through the [RRK deck](https://www.mediafire.com/file/1svvsr7f9cnpwka/Recognition_RTK.apkg/) with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). I had 25 new cards a day selected from a previous deck,  
  and I've just left it. While going through new cards, I'll look through [the book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi) when theres new elements that weren't  
  introduced. For Sentences, I grabbed the [Example Sentence Deck](https://www.mediafire.com/file/422gkvon0o7m5av/Example_Sentence_Cards.apkg) because it has the groups setup already and I'm  
  lazy. I removed any existing sentences that weren't already 1T, and have been adding my new sentences to it.  
  Currently I try to add 10 or so new sentences per day.
